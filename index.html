        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>After graduating college with a degree in biology but not wanting to pursue any medical profession, I was offered a job in a growing solar company. I was technologically literate since youth, which allowed me to solve the company's various data problems by learning SQL for SAP and Excel's VBA. Coding always seemed to me like a difficult undertaking, but after being convinced by peers that I was already doing so at my job, I was eager to take the leap into a new chapter.</p>
        <p>As a student at <strong>Thinkful</strong>, I've started my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be more thrilled!</p>
        <p>Just thinking of how I can bring efficiencies and new concepts into the various industries and apps I love - Sony Playstation, Adobe Creative Suite, PioneerDJ and rekordbox, Apple, and Twitter to name a few - has me excited for the future!</p>
